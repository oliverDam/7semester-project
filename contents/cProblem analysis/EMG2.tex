\section{Some stuff and such stuff and other stuff too}

The following section will contain an explanation of the two main components when acquiring EMG signals, including different electrode designs and the most common preprocessing methods used in EMG acquisition.


\subsection{Electrode designs}



%Use ABC of EMG, Surface Electromyography and maybe also some other books..

%How do we get the signals from the surface of the arm to the devices?


%Simple preprocessing methods for EMG
\subsection{Preprocessing of EMG}
