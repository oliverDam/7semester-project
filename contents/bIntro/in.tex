The loss of a limb... in order to restore the functionalitu and appearance of the limb different kind of prostheses have been developed 
%What is an EMG-prosthesis?

The performance of myoelctric prosthesis is based on the surface EMG signals adquisition from the muscles for further processing in order to activate different functions in the prosthesis. 
%Classic upper-limb EMG prostheses use two electrode pairs, placed on antagonistic muscles, to control one degree of freedom (DOF) [1]. Multifunctional prostheses may pro- vide several more DOF, for example: to control individual fingers [2], or units for wrist (flexion–extension, supination– pronation) and hand (open–keygrip–opposition-grip)
%If a prosthesis provides more than one DOF, switching (e.g. co-contraction of antagonist muscle pairs) of control between DOFs is re- quired [3]. Increasing the number of electrodes to gain more signals is effective only to a limited degree, since muscles work mostly synergistic, i.e. their activity is correlated in most tasks, and because the surface EMG detection is limited by relative large crosstalk between nearby electrodes [4].
