\section{Abstract}

\textbf{Background:} Electromyography (EMG) is widely used as input to the control scheme of myoelectric prosthetics. However, EMG signals change with limb position and thus lowers the accuracy in pattern recognition \cite{Fougner2010}.% and very few studies has assessed this problem.
Most studies have formerly utilized classification for pattern recognition when changing limb position.  
%Inclusion of the use of Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) has proved to raise the accuracy in pattern recognition methods.
However, classification provides only control of one degree of freedom (DoF) at a time, is are computational costly. This study will investigate the usability of linear regression to recognize movements to make a control scheme for myoelectric prosthetics, which has proven to yield robust simultaneous and proportional control\cite{hahne2014}\. The aim is to test and compare the performance of two different features (Mean Absolute Value and Logarithmic variance) when used to recognize movements of four movements at the wrist in three different limb positions. 


\textbf{Methods:} In this study recordings from eight able-bodied subjects has been collected. The data is evaluated through principal component analysis (PCA) and trained with a linear regression model of which the Root Mean Square Error is calculated to evaluate the offline performance. One regressor is trained for each wrist movement for each test subject; four with each feature. The regressors are tested online in a visual environment measuring time to complete a target-reaching task of sixteen targets. The performance of the online test is compared between the different limb positions of the same feature and all limb positions of the two features through statistical analysis.
