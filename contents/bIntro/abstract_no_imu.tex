\section{Abstract}

\textbf{Background:} Electromyography (EMG) is widely used as input to the control scheme of myoelectric prosthetics. However, EMG signals change with limb position and thus lowers the accuracy in pattern recognition \cite{Fougner2010}.% and very few studies has assessed this problem.
Most studies have formerly utilized classification for pattern recognition when changing limb position.  
%Inclusion of the use of Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) has proved to raise the accuracy in pattern recognition methods.
However, classification provides only control of one degree of freedom (DoF) at a time. This study will investigate the usability of linear regression to recognize movements to make a control scheme for myoelectric prosthetics, which has proven to yield robust simultaneous and proportional control\cite{hahne2014}\. The aim is to test and compare the performance of two different features (Mean Absolute Value(MAV) and Logarithmic Variance(LogVar)) when used to recognize movements of four movements at the wrist(flexion, extension, radial deviation and ulnar deviation) in three different limb positions. 


\textbf{Methods:} In this study recordings from seven able-bodied subjects has been collected. The data was evaluated through principal component analysis (PCA) and trained with a linear regression model of which the Root Mean Square Error was calculated to evaluate the offline performance. One regressor was trained for each wrist movement for each test subject: four for each feature. The regressors were tested online in a visual environment where the time to complete a target-reaching task of sixteen targets was measured. The performance of the online test was compared between the different limb positions of the same feature and all limb positions of the two features through statistical analysis(Friedman's test).

\textbf{Results:} 
Using a Friedman's test the performance scores between the three limb positions, when applying the LogVar trained regressors in the online test, prove not to be significantly different(p-value = 0.5647), and the H0 hypothesis can not be rejected. For the MAV trained regressors the H0 hypothesis can not be rejected either(p-value = 0.1561), and thus the performance score between all limb positions can not be proven significantly different. When comparing all performance scores from the two feature trained regression control schemes, the Friedman's test proves no significant difference (p = 0.1266), where the mean of the LogVar and MAV performance scores is 6.4847 sec and 5.5451 sec respectively. The mean of targets reached in for LogVar is 15.0952 and 15.3333 for MAV.

\textbf{Conclusion:} 
In conclusion, both the MAV and LogVar trained regressors showed no significant difference in control between different limb positions. Changing the limb position does therefore not affect the control when a linear regression model is trained with the MAV or LogVar feature. 
% As implied in \cite{Fougner2010}, inclusion of inertial information might yield a more similar performance across different limb positions when using the LogVar feature to train regressors.
