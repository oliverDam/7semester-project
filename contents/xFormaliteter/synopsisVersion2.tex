SYNOPSIS

We focus on people COPD cause they have bad time. We think exercise is good and so do scientists so we know it is good and such and therefore we make them better by making exercise them cause good lungs come from doing stuff. Then we did some code to make people COPD feel good and then they did feel better, so we did an amazing job so much thanks for the applause everyone in the world we know we are more better than everyone else at this, thanks. At last we found out that people COPD might like achievements like "Oh much credit to you sir, you did like 5 kilometers in 1 hour", despite 5 kilometers in 1 hour is like 5 kilometers per hour and that is really slow, but that's OK cause people COPD are terrible at everything anyway and they are bad people in general.
