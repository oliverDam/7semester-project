\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item inclusion of more subjects
	\item sample rate of the myo armband - exclusion of test subjects
	\item even though LogVar shows linearity in a previous study, it does not perform better in linear regression than a presumably non-linear feature
	\item Both features does not show significant difference in control in different limb positions
	\item Whatever the inclusion of IMU shows
	\item It is possible to use regression as control method to yield no significantly different performance in variations of limb positions
	\item Use other regression methods and other features to analyse if it will result in better performance
	\item why does the inclusion of IMU improve the performance
	\item No connection between offline and online tests, which also is shown in previous studies
	\item reasonable control can be archived when donning/doffing(we train the regressors with data, take of the myo armband, and do the testing with the myo armband placed slightly elsewhere)
