\section{Data gathering method}

The data gathering and processing will be done in MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory). This program was chosen, as it is possible to create and implement programs focused on dataprocessing and analysis by using the many thousands of build-in mathematical functions. By using build-in functions it is possible to avoid having to write new code in order to perform advanced mathematical dataanalysis, as the functions within the program will most likely be more effective and precise, as the functions have been written and tested by a lot of people. \cite{chapman2013}

At the same time MATLAB is independent of the computer system used to run the program, which is a feature that is useful when implementing the programs on different platforms, where the visualization of data is an important part of this cross platform performance. When having to gather test-data for EMG systems MATLAB's ability to create GUI's (Graphical User Interfaces) will be a useful tool to show users when to perform different tasks while training the system. \cite{chapman2013}

A disadvantage to the use of MATLAB is that it uses an interpreted language instead of a compiled language, which means the programs might execute slower than for example JAVA or C++. \cite{chapman2013}
