\section{Methods}

Four healthy and able bodied subjects (three men and one woman, ages:) participed in the training session/study. The Myo armband was positioned(to define)
The subjects performed four different hand gestures: ulnar, radial deviation, flexion and extension of the wrist. The order in execution of the movements was the same for each subject. In order to accomplish the study a Graphical User Interface $\left( GUI\right)$ had been created.The subjects of this study were familiar with the operation of the GUI. The acquisition of each hand gesture consited of four chronologic phases: relaxed phase, transition phase, plateau phase and relaxed phase. This are depicted as a trapeze in the GUI. In the performance of each gesture, EMG signals of the subject is represented as a dot in the trapeze window of the GUI.
