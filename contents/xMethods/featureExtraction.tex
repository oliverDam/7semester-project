\section{Feature extraction}
In this section it will be explained which features that are extracted from the EMG data, and which features that behaves more linearly. 

In this project the features mean absolute value and logarithmic variance will be extracted. According to a study by \cite{hahne2014} the logarithmic variance behaves more linearly than features similar to the mean absolute (root means squared). This linear property might yield a better estimation in the recognition of the hand gestures since linear regression is used to as the mapping tool of the hand gestures.



Comparison of the linear properties of the features mean absolute value and logarithmic variance.
Visualize it with a polynomial plot of the different hand gestures with the intensities in prolongation of each other. The x-axis will be the normalized EMG signal and the y-axis will be the ideal values(trapeze plateaus).
