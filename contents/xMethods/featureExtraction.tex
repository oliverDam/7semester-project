\section{Feature extraction}
Explanation of how the features are extracted.

Comparison of the linear properties of the features mean absolute value and logarithmic variance.
Visualize it with a polynomial plot of the different hand gestures with the intensities in prolongation of each other. The x-axis will be the normalized EMG signal and the y-axis will be the ideal values(trapeze plateaus).
