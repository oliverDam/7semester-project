\section{Statistical Analysis}

To determine difference in performance of the regressors when the excluding and including IMU information, statistical analysis is implemented through two-sample t-test. 
Since it wanted to determine if one regressor performs better than the other one-tailed t-test will bu used. 
The t-test follows the standard calculations shown in \eqref{eq:ttest}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ttest}
	t = \frac{\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}}{s_{\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}}}
\end{equation}

Where $\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}$ is the difference between the the means of the two samples. And $s_{\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}}$ is the standard error of the difference between the sample means, and is calculated as shown in \eqref{eq:standardErrorTtest}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:standardErrorTtest}
t = s_{\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}} = sqrt{\frac{num}{den}}
\end{equation}
