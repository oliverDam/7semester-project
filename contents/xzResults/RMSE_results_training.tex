\section{Regression accuracy}
This section includes an examination of the accuracy of the regressors. This will be examined through superimposition of the regressor outputs on the estimated data, and through RMSE plots. 
The plot in \figref{fig:SuperPositionTestDataLogVar} depicts the actual data superimposed on the estimated data from the regressors trained with the logarithmic variance features.

The plot in \figref{fig:SuperPositionTestDataMAV} depicts the actual data superimposed on the estimated data from the regressors trained with the MAV features.

A quantitatively examination of the plots shows that each regressor reacts on the movement it is fitted for, and remains inactive when another movement is performed. This accounts for both features. 
%regression on MAV features yields a more accurate output than regression on the logarithmic variance feature, whereas both estimates yield inaccurate fitting in the high intensities. However, both estimates yield inaccurate fitting in the high intensities compared to the lower intensities, especially in the ulnar deviation movement.
  


Calculating the RMSE of the regressors for the MAV and logarithmic variance features of the training data across all subjects, yields the results depicted in \figref{fig:gimmeThemRMSEBars}.

The overall mean of the RMSE of MAV is 0.0943 with a standard deviation of $\pm 0.0290$, where the highest mean of a regressor is 0.1088 and the highest standard deviation is $\pm 0.0366$. The overall mean of the RMSE of the logarithmic variance is 0.1107 with a standard deviation of $\pm 0.0298$, where the highest mean of a regressor is 0.1216 and the highest standard deviation is $\pm 0.0402$. MAV then yields a lower mean RMSE and a lower standard deviation than the logarithmic variance - both with the overall RMSE and for the movement with the highest RMSE.
