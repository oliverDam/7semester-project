\section{Root mean square error}
Calculating the RMSE of the regressors for the MAV and logarithmic variance features of the training data across all subjects, yields the results depicted in \figref{fig:gimmeThemRMSEBars}. The overall mean of the RMSE of MAV is 0.0867 with a standard deviation of \pm 0.0310, where the highest mean of a regressor is 0.0410 and the highest standard deviation is \pm 0.0975. The overall mean of the RMSE of the logarithmic variance is 0.1047 with a standard deviation of \pm 0.0273, where the highest mean of a regressor is 0.0386 and the highest standard deviation is 0.1097. MAV then yields a lower mean RMSE than the logarithmic variance, where the logarithmic variance has a lower standard deviation than MAV.
