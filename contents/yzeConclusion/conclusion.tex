\section{Conclusion}

This study found that linear regression yields simultaneous and proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom in a stable way independent of limb positions, as it was found that the precision of the regression models enabled the test subjects to perform a target test with similar results independent of the positioning of the arm. Linear regression should be investigated further, as a control scheme with precise, simultaneous and proportional control in more than one limb position. Regression based control schemes could have the potential to be implemented in myoelectric prosthetic devices to improve the functionality, and thereby improving life quality for amputees.
