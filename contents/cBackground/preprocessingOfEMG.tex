\section{Preprocessing of EMG}

Surface EMG is emitted up to $500$ Hz and depending on the area of the EMG acquisition, it is recommended to implement a bandpass filter from $25$ to $500$ Hz in order to avoid low frequency movement artifacts in the recorded signal. If the EMG is acquired from an area close to the heart, it would be preferable to filter from $100$ Hz in order to avoid recording artifacts from the heart. A downside to this bandwidth is that fatigued muscles will fire at a lower rate, which means the performance of the system will be affected when the subject gets tired. \cite{cram2012} %Due to the frequency spectrum of the Myo band, it isn't required to implement a bandpass filter. Instead the signal will be subjected to a highpass filter from $5$ Hz. (The frequency spectrum should be mentioned in the Myo band section and not here I think)

In order to achieve a higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) it is common practice to implement preprocessing methods, including input impedance, differential amplification and filtering. The raw EMG signals has to be preprocessed due to them being sensible to noise elements from the surroundings, since the range of the signal is in the order of millivolts to microvolts. Input impedance is determined by a simple rule in order to avoid defeating the common mode rejection of the EMG amplifier. The rule states that the input impedance of the EMG amplifier has to be between $10$ and $100$ times higher than the impedance of the skin-electrode interface.\cite{cram2012}

Differential amplification is used in EMG in order to amplify the original signal and remove common signals from two or more electrodes, in order to avoid common noise from more electrodes in the amplified signal. The amplifier must have a build in gain as well \fxnote{check what the preprocessing properties are for the Myo armband - this should be mentioned in the myoband section. If we start writing it here, we're mixing stuff from different sections which causes confusion when reading the project..}, which determines the final strength of the signal, and both of these features are implemented in order to avoid the SNR. Basic filtering should be implemented in order to avoid electrical noise. This filter would be implemented as a notch filter, in order to reject the electrical noise and achieve a higher SNR. Furthermore the filtering should include a bandpass filter with a bandwith chosen depending on where the EMG is performed. This is done in order to make sure the final signal doesn't contain irrelevant high and low frequencies.\cite{cram2012}
