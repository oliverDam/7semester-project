\section{"Conclusion" of the background}

This project will focus on the mapping of different hand gestures while having the arm in different positions. This mapping relies on that the generated EMG from the different hand gestures are differentiable. For a prosthetic user a good performing prosthesis must perform hand gestures as well in an elevated limb position as in a seated position to be able to support the user in daily tasks, e.g. taking a cup from a cupboard and pouring water into the cup. However, changes in the EMG occurs when performing the same hand gestures in different limb positions \cite{Fougner2011, avella2006}. These signal alternations can occur for different reasons. Changing limb position can make muscles move under the skin, relative to the placement of the EMG electrodes, resolving in change of the signal source. Muscle contractions in them selves can also make changes to the recorded EMG due to change in the microscopic structure of the muscles caused by overlap of thick and thin filaments. \cite{martini}  
%can lengthen the muscles and result in a change in the signal source relative to the electrode from which the EMG signal is obtained, and even the lengthening of the muscles itself due to changing limb position will alter the EMG activity caused by a degree of overlap of the thick and thin filaments. 
Other findings have shown that the activity of certain muscles' is depending on angles of joints besides those primarily actuating the contraction of these muscles. \cite{Fougner2011} Thus, the effect of limb position must be seen as an important aspect to take into consideration in the mapping of hand gestures to control a prosthesis for the user to receive a good performing support device. 
%Several studies have investigated this effect. 
In 2010, Scheme et al. investigated the effect of different limb positions on pattern recognition based control. They tested eight different limb positions and processed the data using time-domain feature extraction and linear discriminant analysis. Here they found that for each limb position the classification using both EMG and accelerometer data, clearly outperformed using only EMG data. Thus, it might be insufficient to only train the control scheme in one position and expect it to translate to multiple positions. \cite{Fougner2010} 
Several studies have tried to address the problem of limb position and changes in classification accuracy in EMG controlled prosthetics, using different approaches. Patterns recognition has been used in many studies with success in classifying different movements with different limb positions. 

%short reviews of the papers that use patterns classification methods 


 %Fougner et al. proposed in 2011 to combine EMG recordings and accelerometer data when classifying movements in different arm positions. Using pattern recognition they found a reduction in classification error from 18\% to 5\% using this combination.

%also point out that the problem is known and have been addressed in several studies.
