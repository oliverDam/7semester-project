\section{Gaussian Process Regression}

It is known that supervised learning such as regression for continous outputs and classification for discrete outputs is been a relevant 
component of statics and machine learning.\\
Even tough traditionally parametric models have been applied, they seem not easy to work with in more complex tasks. The appearance of Gaussian processes have reveal models which are more easy to perform.\\

A Gaussian Process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of wich have $\left( consistent\right)$ joint Gaussian distributions\cite . It is determined by its mean function $m\left( x\right) $and covariance function  $k\left(x, x'\right)$. While the Gaussian distribution is over vectors the Gaussian process is over functions and is defined as:
\begin{equation}
f \sim GP \left( m,k\right) 
\end{equation}
which means that the function $f$ is distributed as a GP with mean function $m$ and covariance function $k$
