The EMG data recorded by the Myo band contains a lot of both useful and useless data. In order to extract the features which can be used to differ between the movements performed by the wearer, different feature extraction methods can be implemented. In addition to highlighting important features, the implementation of feature extraction will be useful when it comes to removing unwanted signal features caused by noise sources such as the powergrid and movement of the electrodes. \cite{phiny2012}

When analyzing EMG signals there will be three different signal components to be extracted, which are the frequency and time domains, as well as the time-scale representation. Frequency domain features require a Furrier transformation of the signal, which requires more processing than the direct extraction of time domain features. \cite{phiny2012}

The time domain features are performed directly on the raw EMG signal, and these feature extraction methods are often used both for research and practices since they often require very little processing compared to frequency domain features, as the signal do not need to be transformed to the frequency domain before feature extraction. Time domain features are mainly focused on the amplitude of the signal, which means they have a disadvantage if the signal differs in amplitude. \cite{phiny2012}
