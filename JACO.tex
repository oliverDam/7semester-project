\section{JACO$^2$ robotic arm}

In this section a briefly description of the JACO$^2$ robotic arm will be given. \\
The JACO$^2$  is a serial manipulator, which means that this kind of robotic arms are designed as a series of links connected by motor-actuated joints that extend from a base to an end-effector. Any movement in a joint affects all the following joints and links in the chain.
