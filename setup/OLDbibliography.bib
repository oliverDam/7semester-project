abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) across many world regions is high. We aim to estimate COPD prevalence and number of disease cases for the years 1990 and 2010 across world regions based on the best available evidence in publicly accessible scientific databases. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of Medline, EMBASE and Global Health for original, population–based studies providing spirometry–based prevalence rates of COPD across the world from January 1990 to December 2014. Random effects meta–analysis was conducted on extracted crude prevalence rates of COPD, with overall summaries of the meta–estimates (and confidence intervals) reported separately for World Health Organization (WHO) regions, the World Bank's income categories and settings (urban and rural). We developed a meta–regression epidemiological model that we used to estimate the prevalence of COPD in people aged 30 years or more. FINDINGS: Our search returned 37 472 publications. A total of 123 studies based on a spirometry–defined prevalence were retained for the review. From the meta–regression epidemiological model, we estimated about 227.3 million COPD cases in the year 1990 among people aged 30 years or more, corresponding to a global prevalence of 10.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 7.3{\%}–14.0{\%}) in this age group. The number of COPD cases increased to 384 million in 2010, with a global prevalence of 11.7{\%} (8.4{\%}–15.0{\%}). This increase of 68.9{\%} was mainly driven by global demographic changes. Across WHO regions, the highest prevalence was estimated in the Americas (13.3{\%} in 1990 and 15.2{\%} in 2010), and the lowest in South East Asia (7.9{\%} in 1990 and 9.7{\%} in 2010). The percentage increase in COPD cases between 1990 and 2010 was the highest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (118.7{\%}), followed by the African region (102.1{\%}), while the European region recorded the lowest increase (22.5{\%}). In 1990, we estimated about 120.9 million COPD cases among urban dwellers (prevalence of 13.2{\%}) and 106.3 million cases among rural dwellers (prevalence of 8.8{\%}). In 2010, there were more than 230 million COPD cases among urban dwellers (prevalence of 13.6{\%}) and 153.7 million among rural dwellers (prevalence of 9.7{\%}). The overall prevalence in men aged 30 years or more was 14.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 13.3{\%}–15.3{\%}) compared to 7.6{\%} (95{\%} CI 7.0{\%}–8.2{\%}) in women. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a high and growing prevalence of COPD, both globally and regionally. There is a paucity of studies in Africa, South East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean region. There is a need for governments, policy makers and international organizations to consider strengthening collaborations to address COPD globally.},

abstract = {Worldwide, COPD is a leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality. Although its prevalence is already well documented, very few studies have measured its incidence. We therefore investigated the prevalence, incidence and lifetime risk of COPD in the general population. In a population-based study including subjects ??? 40, with 12 months of history available in the Dutch IPCI database, we identified COPD cases by a two-step validation algorithm. Among 185,325 participants with 601,283 years of follow-up, 7308 subjects with COPD were identified, and 1713 had incident COPD. The overall IR of physician-diagnosed COPD was 2.92/1000PY (95{\%}CI 2.78-3.06). The incidence of COPD was higher in men (3.54; 95{\%}CI 3.33-3.77) than in women (2.34; 95{\%}CI 2.17-2.52), and the overall baseline prevalence of COPD was 3.02{\%} (95{\%}CI 2.94-3.10). For people who had entered the study free of COPD at the age of 40, the risk of developing COPD within the next 40 years was 12.7{\%} for men and 8.3{\%} for women. In patients with very severe COPD, 26{\%} died after 1 year of follow-up, whereas 2.8{\%} died among the non-COPD subjects. In the general population in the Netherlands, three on 1000 subjects were diagnosed with COPD per year. The incidence increased rapidly with age and was higher in men than in women. One in eight men and one in 12 women, being COPD free at the age of 40, will develop COPD during their further life. Mortality rates differed substantially between COPD patients and non-COPD subjects of the same age, underlining the burden of this disease. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@book{umlguide,
abstract = {Introduced in 1997, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) has rapidly been accepted throughout the software industry as the standard graphical language for specifying, constructing, visualizing and documenting software-intensive systems. The UML provides anyone involved in the production, deployment, and maintenance of software with a standard notation for expressing a system's blueprint. The UML covers conceptual things, such as business processes and system functions, as well as concrete things, such as programming-language classes, database schemas, and reusable software components. In textitThe Unified Modeling Language User Guide, the original developers of the UML--Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson--provide a tutorial to the core aspects of the language in a two-color format designed to facilitate learning. Starting with a conceptual model of the UML, the book progressively applies the UML to a series of increasingly complex modeling problems across a variety of application domains. This example-driven approach helps readers quickly understand and apply the UML. For more advanced developers, the book includes a learning track focused on applying the UML to advanced modeling problems. With textitThe Unified Modeling Language User Guide, readers will: beginitemize item Understand what the UML is, what it is not, and why it is relevant to the development of software-intensive systems. item Master the vocabulary, rules, and idioms of the UML in order to ``speak" the language effectively. item Learn how to apply the UML to a number of common modeling problems. item See illustrations of the UML's use interspersed with use cases for specific UML features. item Gain insight into the UML from the original creators of the UML. enditemize},

@article{cavalheri2016,
abstract = {People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) engage in low levels of physical activity (PA). Given the evidence for the health benefits associated with participating in 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA each week, there is considerable interest in methods to increase PA in people with COPD. Studies to date have focused largely on exercise training and behavioural approaches, and many have demonstrated minimal, if any effect. An intermediate goal that focuses on reducing time spent in sedentary behaviour (SB) and increasing participation in light intensity PA is a more realistic goal in this population and offers a gateway to higher intensity PA. Although strategies that are capable of reducing time spent in SB in COPD are unknown, studies that have shown some increase in PA in this population often provide individualized goal setting, motivational interviewing and frequent contact with health-care professionals to provide advice regarding strategies to overcome barriers. Therefore, these approaches should be considered in interventions to reduce time in SB. There are a range of devices available to monitor time in SB for use in both clinical and research settings. To move this area forward, a theoretically informed and systematic approach to behaviour change is needed. The theoretical model, the 'behaviour change wheel', is described and an example is provided of how it can be applied to a person with COPD.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) has been shown to improve exercise capacity, health status, anxiety and depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the response in younger and elderly patients has not been fully established. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of PR in elderly people. METHODS: Patients younger ({\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\pounds}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}65 years) and older ({\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}65 years) with stable COPD underwent an 8 week outpatient PR twice weekly and home exercise training. Dyspnea, incremental shuttle walk distance (ISWT), health status (SGRQ), anxiety and depression (HAD) were assessed before and after PR. A comparison was made between younger and elderly patients. RESULTS: The study group included 109 patients with COPD. There were 52 patients (mean age 58.96±4.63 yrs) in the younger and 57 patients (mean age 73.58±5.75 yrs) in the elderly group. The increase in walking distance in younger patients was 76.86±93.18m (p{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\textless}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}0.0001) and 34.64±60.35m (p{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\textless}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}0.0001) in the elderly group after the data was compared to the baseline. In the younger group, the decrease in BORG was -0.46±1.50 (p=0.04) whereas it was -0.12±0.96 (p=0.35) among the elderly patients. Although SGRQ, HAD improved significantly after PR in younger patients, the improvement was only 'total' score in the elderly. Comparing the mean changes after PR, both age groups showed similar improvements in dyspnea, SGRQ and HAD (p=NS). Only walking distance increased in the younger ages after PR (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with COPD benefit from PR as much as younger patients and should not be excluded because of age.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to investigate the motivation, ability, preferences, and perceived potential facilitating factors/barriers of patients with inoperable metastatic lung cancer towards exercise programmes. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study using survey adopting the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to obtain patients' experience recruited through Odette Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Complex. Results were expressed in percentages, P value, and Spearman's rho. RESULTS Sixty patients were recruited from January 2014 to April 2014. Patients generally had a high level across TPB measures, with 63{\%} of them indicating that they have the motivation to exercise. Significant association in relation to motivation was established on attitudes (importance, P = 0.005, rho = 0.326; helpfulness, P = 0.015, rho = 0.348; and easiness, P = 0.001, rho = 0.375) and subjective norm of close members (P = 0.0069, rho = 0.348) and healthcare professionals (P = 0.012, rho = 0.328). Being a non-smoker (P = 0.042, rho = 0.311), having a past exercise history prior to diagnosis (P = 0.000, rho = 0.563), and absence of COPD (P = 0.016, rho = -0.312) were also shown to have a significant association with motivation to exercise. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS Patients were motivated to participate in an exercise programme despite contrary belief; however, they might have limited ability and preferred light intensity type of exercise such as walking. Their motivation to exercise was driven by different factors when compared to other cancer patient populations. Thus, it is important for healthcare professionals to understand the factors influencing their motivation and increase their awareness (only 26{\%} of patients indicated receiving advice regarding exercise) to better the care towards patients with metastatic lung cancer.},

abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents an increasing burden throughout the world. COPD-related mortality is probably underestimated because of the difficulties associated with identifying the precise cause of death. Respiratory failure is considered the major cause of death in advanced COPD. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and lung cancer are also major causes and, in mild-to-moderate COPD, are the leading causes of mortality. The links between COPD and these conditions are not fully understood. However, a link through the inflammation pathway has been suggested, as persistent low-grade pulmonary and systemic inflammation, both known risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer, are present in COPD independent of cigarette smoking. Lung-specific measurements, such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), predict mortality in COPD and in the general population. However, composite tools, such as health-status measurements (e.g. St George's Respiratory Questionnaire) and the BODE index, which incorporates Body mass index, lung function (airflow Obstruction), Dyspnoea and Exercise capacity, predict mortality better than FEV(1) alone. These multidimensional tools may be more valuable because, unlike predictive approaches based on single parameters, they can reflect the range of comorbidities and the complexity of underlying mechanisms associated with COPD. The current paper reviews the role of comorbidities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality, the putative underlying pathogenic link between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and comorbid conditions (i.e. inflammation), and the tools used to predict chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality.},

abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the leading causes of death and morbidity worldwide. Despite intensive investigation, its pathology and pathophysiology are not well understood. The hallmarks of the disease are irreversible airflow limitation and chronic inflammation. Small airway obstruction due to progressive inflammation and fibrosis, and the loss of elastic recoil mediated by elastolysis and apoptosis equally contribute to pathologic changes. However, it is debated to what extent the obstruction of large airways leads to altered lung function. Three morphologic entities are described in the literature under one disease; chronic bronchitis, obstructive bronchiolitis and emphysema may appear in the same patient at the same time. The authors review pathologic changes observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including acute exacerbations and secondary pulmonary hypertension as severe but common complications of the disease. Furthermore, we detail recent scientific evidences for major cellular and molecular inflammatory pathway activation. These mechanisms result in accelerated apoptosis, remodeling and increased proinflammatory cytokine release. Targeting intracellular pathological changes may lead to the discovery of a new generation of drugs that could reduce chronic obstruction before airway irreversibility is established.},
