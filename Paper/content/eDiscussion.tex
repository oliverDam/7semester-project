Some introducing words

\textbf{Comparison of features}
In the results it was found that there was no significant difference between the performance of LogVar and MAV for the performance scores both with (p = 0.5637) and without (p = 0.0833) IMU data included. Based on a study \cite{hahne2014} showing LogVar as a feature with linear properties, it would be expected that this feature would perform better in a linear regression model, than a feature which to the authors knowledge has not been proven to be linear. On the contrary it was shown that a significantly higher number of targets was reached with a linear regression models based on the MAV feature with IMU included, compared to the LogVar regression model with IMU included (p = 0.0017). When IMU data was not included, there was no difference between the number of targets reached in the test (p = 1).

Further studies within this field should consider examining other features, while studying the effect of combining several features in order to further improve performance independent of the limb position.

\textbf{Inclusion of IMU data}
The IMU data included in this study was based on a single accelerometer, where it was expected that the Myo armband would give a similar output as long as the subjects were performing both training and testing from the same starting position. Inclusion of the IMU data was shown to yield the same results in the online test scores, with no significant difference for either MAV (p = 0.1779) or LogVar (p = 0.5637) when comparing regression models trained with and without accelerometer inputs. It was found that the inclusion of the IMU data yielded significantly poorer results for the LogVar regression model (p = 0.0016), while it led to a significant improvement of the MAV regression model (p = 0.0124) when examining the number of reached targets. The inclusion of IMU data could be a subject of further investigation, as the results might be improved by implementing a system capable of measuring the angles of the joints, in order to create a more versatile and usable regression model outside the clinical environment. Including IMU data could additionally be used to select specific regression models, if a system was build with models for different limb positions instead of the same regressors for all positions.

\textbf{Stability in limb positions}
When excluding IMU data, there was no significant difference between the target score for either LogVar (p = 0.2359) or MAV (p = 0.8948) in the different limb positions, while there was a difference between the number of reached targets for MAV (0.0212) but no difference for LogVar (p = 0.4220). This outcome shows that both MAV and LogVar yields rather stable performance in different limb positions in a linear regression-based control scheme. This finding agrees with Hwang et al. \cite{Hwang2017}, who equivalently found stable online performance across limb positions in a linear regression-based control scheme applying RMS as feature.

When including IMU data the MAV based regression model was shown to have a significant difference in scores between limb positions (p = 0.0319), while LogVar did not show any difference (p = 0.4594). While the target reaching time were shown to be different depending on limb positions when using MAV, the number of targets reached was improved, as there was no significantly difference (p = 0.2957) in the amount of targets reached. The LogVar feature based regression models were shown to have a difference between reached targets when using IMU data (p = 0.0037).

Overall the LogVar regression models were observed as being the most unstable in the different limb positions when looking at the test subjects performance in the target test. This might be a result of the LogVar feature being based on the change of the signal, as this could lead to problems with crosstalk, when the arm is not in a relaxed state. The MAV was observed as being more stable, with the subjects being able to create more smooth movements as well as being able to controllably return to the resting position. Based on the findings of this study, it would be recommended to examine features based on the amplitude rather than the variance in future studies within this area.


\textbf{Offline vs. online training}
Offline testing was only done for MAV and LogVar without IMU data included. A significant difference between the two features when testing with training data (p = 0.0044) was archived in the offline test, but no significant difference when testing with new data (p = 0.1138). Comparing RMSE of LogVar with training data and RMSE of LogVar with new data there is a significant difference (P = 0.0001) where RMSE of the test with new data has the higher mean. Same results are yielded for the MAV trained regressors (P = 0.000005). This indicates that the regression models are overfitted when exposed to new data. The online results yielded robost control across all limb positions, and therefore no apparent correlation between offline and online testing. This could be caused by the subjects ability to adjust to a poor fitted model when given visual feedback while performing the target-reaching test. This observation corresponds to findings in another study \cite{jiang2010}.


\textbf{Limitations of the study}
This study was based on data from 12 test subjects, where three had to be excluded. One subject was excluded due to misunderstanding the given instructions and thereby creating an unusable set of training and test data. This limited the control of the regression models giving the subject a mean score above 25 seconds per target reached and average number of reached targets below 10 for all tests.

Two other subjects were excluded as the recorded intensities were not high enough to differ between the baseline and the higher EMG intensity. This caused the regression models to interpret the baseline in the target test as movements being performed at between 30\% and 70\% of the MVC. 

To improve the validity of the study more test subjects should be included in further studies within this field. Subjects with transradial amputations should also be taken into consideration if regression based control schemes were to be considered for future use in myoelectric prosthetic devices. 

Using the Myo armband for data acquisition limited the sampling rate to 200 Hz. Only the 0-100 Hz spectrum of the EMG was represented correctly, where frequencies above 100Hz was affected by aliasing. Along with frequency representation limitations, the Myo armband restricted the number and placement of electrodes to eight channels placed at the same distance distal to the elbow joint, where it might be possible to yield better results with a different electrode placement and number of channels. Further studies should implement conventional EMG electrodes and an ADC with a sample rate, enabling the entire frequency band of EMG signals to be acquired correctly.

%	During the results examination it was found that there is no apparent correlation between the offline and online results for both features under study. 
%	%On the one hand the offline outcomes illustrates overfitting of the regression models. On the other hand the online test yielded robust control of the wrist movements performanced in the three different limb positions. 
%	This could be owing to the subjects$'$ ability to compensate for a poorer fitting model when visual feedback is provided while performing the target test. This conclusion corresponds to the findings in other study \cite{jiang2010}.

%	
%	The inclusion of IMU data proved no significant difference for both features in the test score. However the inclusion of IMU data led in better results in the number of reached targets for MAV (p = 0.0124) than LogVar (p = 0.0016). It was expected that the inclusion of IMU for this study would give similar output since the input data was based on a single accelerometer and the performance was executed in the same position. The inclusion of IMU data could be a subject of further investigation, as the results might be improved by implementing a system capable of measuring the angles of the joints, in order to create a more versatile and usable regression model outside the clinical environment.

%	
%	%Using the Myo band for data acquisition led to certain limitations in the sample rate, as the device is only capable of recording signals between 0 and 200Hz. This leads to the final signal being recorded between 0 and 100Hz, where everything above 100Hz is affected by aliasing. Along with frequency limitations, the Myo band restricted the number and placement of electrodes to eight channels placed at the same distance from the elbow, where it might be possible to yield better results with a different electrode placement and number. Further studies should implement regular EMG electrodes in order to obtain a more usable and clear signal, that represents the entire frequency band of EMG signals.
%	
%	During the accomplishment of this study some of the subjects were not able to perform consistently throughout the data set. In order to ensure constant data those subjects were exclude. Even though the final results present that is possible to achieve simultaneous and proportional control using Myo armband, it had been shown that the sampling rate of this device was a limitation on the acquisition of sEMG data. This could be due to the fact that sEMG signals rate is between 10-500Hz, however the sampling rate of the Myoarmband is 200Hz, this fact leads on the sEMG signals above 100Hz would be affected by aliasing. Furthermore the quantity and placement of electrodes was restricted because of the Myo armband. It is believed that the implementation of regular EMG electrodes could elicit better results. To improve the validity of the study more test subjects should be included in further studies within this field. Subjects with transradial amputations should also be taken into consideration if the regression based control schemes were to be considered for future use in myoelectric prosthetic devices.
